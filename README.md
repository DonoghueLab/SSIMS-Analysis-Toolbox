### Quick-Guide ####
The purpose of this toolbox is to generate dimensionality-reduced **S**pike train **Sim**ilarity (SSIM) Maps from discrete or continuous neural data, facilitating visualization and further analysis. 

To get started: 
1. Download the tool box from Github: [Toolbox Repository](https://github.com/DonoghueLab/SSIMS-Analysis-Toolbox) 

2. Add toolbox to your MATLAB path.

3. **Optional, but recommended** Installation of complied Matlab code for significantly(!) increased performance see 'install.md'. 

4. Open **SSIMS_democenter_out.m** in Matlab: for guidance on using SSIMS (dim-reduced Ensemble Activity Spiketrain Simliarty Maps) with a single demo dataset (discrete data).  

5. For more details on both methods see publication [1] or our webpage: [Donoghue Lab - Github Page - Analysis Toolbox](https://donoghuelab.github.io/SSIMS-Analysis-Toolbox/).
